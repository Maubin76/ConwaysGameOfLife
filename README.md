# ConwaysGameOfLife

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal project. I coded Conway's Game Of Life. This "game" is incredible if we compare its complexity and the outcome we are able to create. Indeed, the rules are so simple you may wonder what is the goal of such an app. However, Nicolas Loizeau created a whole computer all logic gates. For more information I suggest to visit <a href="https://www.nicolasloizeau.com/gol-computer">this website</a>.

## Rules

This file's goal is not to explain the whole game. If you don't know it, you should visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">wiki</a>.

## Compilation and execution

As I chose to use the C language for my app, you can compile with gcc 
````bash
gcc ConwaysGameOfLife.c -o ConwaysGameOfLife
````
